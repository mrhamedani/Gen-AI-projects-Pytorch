**1. FashionMNIST-Classification:**
FashionMNIST database belongs to PyTorch and contains a large number of black and white photos of types of clothing (pants, jackets, etc.). In this project, the goal is to classify all kinds of clothes.Important features: 
- EarlyStop
- prediction


**2. FashionMNIST_GAN:** 
The dataset from the previous project has been reworked except that this time the goal is to generate images (not classification) using training.In this project, photos are made by Generative Adversarial Network method.Important features: 
- discriminative and generative
- Real and fake data and labels


**3. AnimeFaces_DCGAN:** 
In this project, the Kaggle dataset called AnimeFaces is used, which contains color photos of anime faces. And the goal of creating a photo is similar to the CNN method (DCGAN or Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network).Important features:
- Professional model building with CNN
- color photos (3 channels)
